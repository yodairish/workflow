# Yodairish workflow

Basic set of plugins and instructions that you can use when starting a new project.

## Getting started

  - Clone the repository to a some folder or just download zip.

  - Copy files to root of your new project.

  - Change in `packege.json` and `bower.json` the required fields like 'name', 'description', 'authors'.. then use `npm install`.
  
  - Move files from `hooks` folder to `.git/hooks`.
